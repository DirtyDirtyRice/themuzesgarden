musical database for download and output
a free open source database for users to input musical info for members to use.

primarily used for performing cover songs using the database as an information center.

members would download audio, video, text, tab and any other info that might help themselves and other members perform songs.
songs would be both cover tunes and original material.
audio downloads could be in several formats.
the software would take the files and convert them into the same format, so the output from the database would be the same for all users.

the audio dowloads would have several options from a single track, several tracks to a mastered song track
output from the database might include: single track audio files, mastered songs, lyric display, chord/lyric display, tab display
some of the tools that the software might offer for the members could be 
changing: the bpm, key of song, patches and samples ----

the database would primarily be for original versions of cover songs.
MEMBERS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE AUDIO MATERIAL FOR RECORDING WITHOUT GETTING PERMISSION FROM THE WRITER(S) OF THE SONG.
MEMBERS WOULD NOT NEED PERMISSION TO PERFORM THE COVER TUNES.

the site would also have access for members to share thier ideas and thier knowledge(how did you do that)

projects could also be started by members for creating songs both cover and original.
